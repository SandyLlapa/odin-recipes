  <p>These delectable crispy fried beef tacos, also known as "Arizona Tacos," are currently gaining popularity on TikTok. The preparation involves pressing raw meat onto a tortilla and then frying it until it achieves a perfect, crunchy exterior while retaining a tender and juicy filling. The best part is that these tacos are relatively simple to make. Let me walk you through the process:</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>8 (5-inch) corn tortillas</li>
    <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed for frying</li>
    <li>1/2 cup minced white onion</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>lime wedges, for serving</li>
    <li>1/4 cup salsa, or as needed, for serving</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients needed.</li>
    <li>Lay 8 tortillas on a flat surface.</li>
    <li>Combine beef, taco seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Press 1/4 cups of beef mixture onto half of each tortilla. </li>
    <li>Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, carefully add one taco at a time, flat, to the hot oil.</li>
    <li>Hold empty side of the tortilla with a pair of tongs, and fold over beef filling once the shell is softened, about 5 seconds.</li>
    <li>Cook, turning once, until shell is golden brown and beef is no longer pink in the center, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side.. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. </li>
    <li>Serve immediately topped with onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, salsa, and hot sauce.</li>
  </ol>
